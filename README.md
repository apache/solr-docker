# What is Apache Solrâ„¢?

Apache Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more.
Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Learn more on [Solr's homepage](https://solr.apache.org) and in the [Solr Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr?tab=tags) for a list of image tags available to pull.
Note that the Apache Solr project does not support any releases older than the current major release series, despite whatever tags are published.

The official Dockerfile is released along-side Solr.
Therefore the project has decided to not support changes to Dockerfiles after release.
Changes must be made to [github.com/apache/solr](https://github.com/apache/solr), which will then be included in the next targeted release.
